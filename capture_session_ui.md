Capture Session UI

Goal
Provide a glove-friendly entry point for data collection without overloading the Free Practice flow.

Changes
Added a dedicated "Capture Session" card to the Training landing page.
It routes into the existing training flow and uses the same capture panel and frame cap logic.

Trainer Flow
1. Open Training page.
2. Click Capture Session.
3. Enter gesture name.
4. Start Recording.
5. Perform sync tap, then the sign.
6. Stop Recording or wait for frame cap.
7. Download CSV and metadata.

Notes
Frame caps are set in Settings (100/150/200).
Timestamps are stored as epoch ms in CSV and metadata.
